Click Event: browser events allow me to communicate with the website and allows me to set up interactions between the user and website when the user is navigating through it

Background Random Color: event handlers allow me to again, communicate with the website but makes certain restrictions on when the website will communicate with the user for certain events

classList Toggle: toggling classes using classList property is interesting, it allows me to set up different interactions and allows for the user to be communicated to in different ways by toggling classes on and off

Dark Mode: classList allows me to again, set up interactions between the user and the website they are navigating through. With just a simple push of a button it allows the website to communicate to the user on what the user wants to do and it can toggle back and forth between the different classes

To Do Task: it's interesting, we are creating a list element returning it in the function that it was created, then in another function we call it and the list item gets returned, then we append it into the unlisted element we have and then we have to clear the value of the text so that it can be recycled. This allows for us to communicate with a website on how we want to add more elements or remove more elements when the user wishes to do so
